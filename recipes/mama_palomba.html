    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hot and mild Italian sausages combine with ground chuck in this rich tomato and meat sauce. It simmers on the stove for hours, developing a flavorful and rich sauce. "Thick and meaty," says Michael, "A very flexible recipe and great to freeze for last minute needs."</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (28 ounce) cans plum tomato puree</li>
        <li>½ pound hot Italian sausage, sliced into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>½ pound mild Italian sausage, sliced into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>2 pounds ground chuck</li>

        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, diced</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>1 (12 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
